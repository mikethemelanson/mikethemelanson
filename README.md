Howdy!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Senior Editor with [The ReadME Project](https://github.com/readme) where we feature the stories of the people behind open source and dig into the trends of open source software and developers. I have been writing about the internet on the internet since 2009, when I joined ReadWriteWeb as a daily news writer, and have been using the internet since the days of 1200 baud dial-up and BBS door games. I have written for ReadWriteWeb, VentureBeat, and The New Stack, covering topics far and wide, from social media to infrastructure at scale, from smart phone apps to programming language design.

Offline, I enjoy riding bicycles for both fun and transportation, gardening, foraging mushrooms and other edibles as I hike with my partner and our dog, and getting involved in cooperative efforts, such as [our local bicycle co-op](http://bsbc.co). One of the things I'm most excited to explore at the ReadME Project is everything related to open source software - the people, the communities, the ideologies, and the software itself. I have been part of a number of similarly "open" source efforts, such as housing co-ops, bicycle co-ops, and volunteer-run festivals, and I am stoked to tell the stories of these same sorts of efforts and ideas in the world of open source software.

I am always happy to hear your story ideas and thoughts on what is happening in the world of open source software, so please reach out to me at [mikethemelanson@github.com](mailto:mikethemelanson@github.com).
