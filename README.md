## Howdy! 👋 

I'm a Senior Editor with [The ReadME Project](https://github.com/readme) where we feature the stories of the people behind open source and dig into the trends of open source software and developers. I have been writing about the 💻 internet on the internet since 2009, when I joined [ReadWriteWeb](https://readwrite.com/author/mike-melanson/) as a daily news writer, and have been using the internet in some form or another since the days of 1200 baud ☎️ dial-up and BBS door games. Most recently, I learned all about the world of ☁️ cloud native computing while writing for [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/author/mike-melanson/).

## Here are my latest articles with The ReadME Project:
- [TypeScript and the dawn of gradual types](https://github.com/readme/featured/typescript-gradual-types) - 🌅 Why choose between static or dynamic when you can get the best of both?
- [How ‘open’ should your open source be?](https://github.com/readme/featured/how-open-is-open-source) - 🛑 Boundaries aren't always intuitive for maintainers, but limiting contributions can be their healthiest option.
- [Coding accessibility: Disability as catalyst for creativity](https://github.com/readme/featured/disability-creativity) - 🎮 👨‍🦼 Faced with accessibility barriers, developer Paul Chiou turns obstacles into innovative solutions.
- [From gaming with your eyes to coding with AI: New frontiers for accessibility](https://github.com/readme/featured/open-source-accessibility) - 👀 🎮 With open source, developers with disabilities can contribute, collaborate, and participate like never before.
- [What's in a name? Moving GitOps beyond buzzword](https://github.com/readme/featured/defining-gitops) - 🧰 An open source effort to define GitOps might save it from becoming just another buzzword.
- [Marie Kondo your software stack with open source](https://github.com/readme/featured/open-source-minimalism) - 🧹 Mindfully consider each choice—and remember that simple is not necessarily easy
- [Don’t call it a comeback: Why Java is still champ](https://github.com/readme/featured/java-programming-language) - ☕ Far from dead, the perpetually-popular language is up to speed and ready for the future.

## Offline
I enjoy riding 🚴 bicycles for both fun and transportation, 🍅 gardening, 🍄 foraging mushrooms and other edibles as I hike with my partner and our 🐶 dogs, and getting involved in cooperative efforts, such as [our local bicycle co-op](http://bsbc.co). 

Oh, and fun fact - I wrote a [blog post about Facebook](https://readwrite.com/facebook_wants_to_be_your_one_true_login/) one time that accidentally stepped into the firehose of people searching for "Facebook login" on Google instead of typing "facebook.com" into their browser, and [hilarity ensued](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-want-the-old-facebook-back). Some folks refer to it as the time I "broke the internet."
