## About Mike Melanson

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
* I am often honest and unfiltered, myself. I tend to focus on getting a message across far more than *how*  that message is delivered, which comes off far more gruff than I intend. I’m a native New Englander, so that likely accentuates that quality. When I’m editing something, debating an idea, discussing a problem, I can be intense, but my intensity is primarily about the writing/idea/topic, like it’s a puzzle, and not about the people involved. I can forget about the **people** and overly focus on the **idea**. 
* I’m also ADHD, and I think likely neurodivergent in some other ways too. My brain can be annoyingly good at picking out subtle differences, which I can get stuck on.
* Knowing how I'm feeling about something can be hard for me to put into words and, depending on the topic, it can take me some time to parse the information and have an answer. 
* I often need time for my thoughts to percolate, which can look like me stepping away from the computer, getting outside, and getting my heart rate up. I think that the best way to get something done sometimes is to step away from it.
* My bullshit/inconsistency detector can be highly sensitive, and it’s something that my brain can get caught on.
* I try to find ways to automate whatever I can, and can’t help but try to improve processes. And again, I may forget about the people aspect when analyzing, critiquing, and debating that process.
* I've dabbled in technology since I was a kid, and nowadays I have referred to myself as [I am the programming equivalent of a home cook](https://thenewstack.io/this-week-in-programming-what-kind-of-developer-are-you-anyway/) who's maybe run an ice cream truck for a summer, worked in the kitchen at some festivals, and been tasked with bulk cooking and dumpster diving for the co-op. (While a metaphor, those are all real life things, too.)
 	 
### What drives you nuts?
* *Tell us about your pet peeves. These are things that put you in a bad mood.*
* Business speak. As @ryanjsalva said in his [departure post](https://github.com/github/product/discussions/1555), “When talking with customers, share concrete use cases and avoid vacuous business-speak.” My vote is for always avoiding vacuous business-speak.
* No-call, no-shows and (repeated) last-minute cancellations. There’s already a period of time before and after a call where I can get absolutely nothing done, but when it’s all for nothing, it’s just annoying.
* When I can't get myself started on a project. 

### What are your quirks?
* *Tell us about those traits that are uniquely yours. How do you like to make decisions? How do you react to conflict?*
* I’m told I can be “hard to read”, but rest assured, I will share my feelings about something when I have them and know what they are. At the same time, I don’t think I have much of a poker face and I’m a generally fidgety human to begin with, so I may come off as uneasy about something when really I just seem uneasy in general.
* 

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
* *Think of some labels people may apply to you. Tell us why those are wrong.*
* That I’m unfeeling, or grumpy. After some time seeing myself on Zoom, I now know that my face often doesn't convey what I think it does. To me, I can feel the muscles tensing that make a smile, but then I’ll look at Zoom and see that I look expressionless. 
* I can be emphatic, and people can take this as aggression. In reality, I’m often overly focused on the idea or problem that I’m trying to understand and solve, and my passion is directed at the idea, not people. 

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
* *Tell us what your ideal colleague would look like. These are the people you normally seek out at work.* 
* I like how the vast array of qualities in a team add together to augment each other and fill in the gaps.
* Colleagues who I can talk to as a person rather than as a colleague.
* Colleagues who aren’t ashamed to ask questions and admit they don’t know something.
* Colleagues who make the effort to find the most source-of-truth information that they can and share it with their team.
* _(the above three points stolen from @nicolechoi)_

### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?
* *Think of the people you avoid at work. What are their characteristics?*
* Vague business-speak and overusing buzz-words like “best in breed” and empty language. 
* Chronic unresponsiveness, whether in Google Docs, threads in Slack, etc. 
	
### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
* *Think of the time when a colleague puts a smile on your face. What did they just do?*
* Pay attention to details.
* Talk about your passions.
* Do whatever things it is that you do that brought you here, because you're good at it.

## About my interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
* *Tell us how you like to help others.*
* Sharing the things that the super smart, awesome people have shared with me over the years.  
* As an editor, I ask lots of questions that I’m sure, at times, can be annoying and seem to have obvious answers. One of the many nice things about having an editor is having another set of eyes to point out the things that you might miss because you're too familiar with the topic or content, or just because we're all human and mis things.
* Making connections, either by sharing information, resources, or people who may provide them. 

### What’s the best way to communicate with you?
* *If you hate emails, tell us. If you prefer a quick zoom over a 15 min write up, tell us.*
* I love not having a strict schedule, which means I'm often on the move. I'm responsive by Slack much of the time. I often plan my days around my calls, that way I can change work locations and get exercise at the same time.
* Zoom is great for various reasons - "too difficult to explain by text" conversations, actually seeing people and hearing their voice, collaborating visually and in real-time. That said, I like to have some heads up, if possible.  If you don’t mind chatting with me in a coffee shop or something, then I don’t either.
* GitHub Discussions and other async methods offer a different level of interaction and I enjoy them for discussing ideas and providing durable records. 
	
### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
* *Tell us how we can change your mind, once it’s made up.*
* Help me understand.
* My brain gets stuck easily on what I see as contradictions, injustices, misalignments, etc, which can be a superpower for editing and making copy stronger, but can also feel impossible to move forward from if I can’t reconcile whatever seems off or unanswered.

### How do you like to give feedback?
* *Tell us the modes, means, timing, approach, and level of detail you like to employ when giving feedback, and why that's so.*
* Most “feedback” I give is in the form of editing, which come as suggested edits, often with rationale for my suggestions as comments. 

### How do you like to get feedback?
* *Tell us the modes, means, timing, approach, and level of detail you like to see others employ when giving you feedback, and why that's so.*
* I like direct feedback, as hinting, indirect feedback can feel like passive aggressiveness.
