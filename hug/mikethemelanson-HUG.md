## About Mike Melanson

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
* I am often honest and unfiltered, myself. I tend to focus on getting a message across far more than *how*  that message is delivered, which comes off far more gruff than I intend. I’m a native New Englander, so that likely accentuates that quality. When I’m editing something, debating an idea, discussing a problem, I can be intense, but my intensity is primarily about the writing/idea/topic, like it’s a puzzle, and not about the people involved. I can forget about the **people** and overly focus on the **idea**. 
* I’m also ADHD, and I think likely neurodivergent in some other ways too. My brain can be annoyingly good at picking out subtle differences, which I can get stuck on.
* Knowing how I'm feeling about something can be hard for me to put into words and, depending on the topic, it can take me some time to parse the information and have an answer. 
* I often need time for my thoughts to percolate, which can look like me stepping away from the computer, getting outside, and getting my heart rate up. I think that the best way to get something done sometimes is to step away from it.
* My bullshit detector can be highly sensitive, and it’s something that my brain can get caught on.
* I try to find ways to automate whatever I can, and can’t help but try to improve processes. And again, I may forget about the people aspect when analyzing, critiquing, and debating that process. 
 	 
### What drives you nuts?
* *Tell us about your pet peeves. These are things that put you in a bad mood.*
* Business speak. As @ryanjsalva said in his [departure post](https://github.com/github/product/discussions/1555), “When talking with customers, share concrete use cases and avoid vacuous business-speak.” My vote is for always avoiding vacuous business-speak.
* No-call, no-shows and (repeated) last-minute cancellations. There’s already a period of time before and after a call where I can get absolutely nothing done, but when it’s all for nothing, it’s just annoying. 

### What are your quirks?
* *Tell us about those traits that are uniquely yours. How do you like to make decisions? How do you react to conflict?*
* I’m told I can be “hard to read”, but rest assured, I will share my feelings about something when I have them and know what they are. At the same time, I don’t think I have much of a poker face and I’m a generally fidgety human to begin with, so I may come off as uneasy about something when really I’m just uneasy, in general. 

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
* *Think of some labels people may apply to you. Tell us why those are wrong.*
I think people might think I’m unfeeling, or grumpy, but I don’t *feel* that way. I seem to have a resting grimace that I didn’t really know about until I saw myself on Zoom all the time. To me, I can feel the muscles tensing that make a smile, but then I’ll look, and I’ll look expressionless. (Not that I don’t smile, I do, and it will be obvious—just not obvious as often as I think it is.) I can also be overly-emphatic, and people can take this as aggression. In reality, I’m often overly focused on the idea or problem that I’m trying to understand and solve, and my passion is directed at the idea, not people. 

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
* *Tell us what your ideal colleague would look like. These are the people you normally seek out at work.* 
I like how the vast array of qualities adds up to a team of diverse people working together and augmenting each other. My ideal colleagues speak directly and don’t beat around the bush. 

### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?
* *Think of the people you avoid at work. What are their characteristics?*
* I return again to disliking vague business-speak. Add to that an overuse of acronyms and buzz-words like “best in breed”. 
* That “no-call no-show” thing I mentioned earlier, for sure, but that also extends to general communication. Not responding to comments in Google Docs, threads in Slack, etc, all mean someone else has to put in more time to chase those things down.
	
### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
* *Think of the time when a colleague puts a smile on your face. What did they just do?*
* By paying attention to the details, using the systems in place, being organized and timely, and helping to find new systems and processes to make our workflows more efficient. 

## About my interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
* *Tell us how you like to help others.*
* Mostly by sharing the things that people have shared with me. I feel like I’ve been taught by and worked with a great variety of folks who’re super awesome and great at what they do, and they usually say or do things that stick with me. 
* As an editor, I ask lots of questions that I’m sure, at times, are very annoying and seem to have obvious answers, but I hope offer opportunities to evaluate assumptions and strengthen our work.

### What’s the best way to communicate with you?
* *If you hate emails, tell us. If you prefer a quick zoom over a 15 min write up, tell us.*
* One of my favorite parts of remote work is not having a strict schedule. I often need to move around and change locations, and am happy to communicate via Slack. I also think things like GitHub Discussions and other async methods are great. Email actually feels a bit harder, because I feel like I have to put more care into crafting email. I started out on chat at a very early age for someone my age, so I’m pretty comfortable with it. Zoom calls are definitely good in a remote job, but I like to have some heads up, if possible. I often plan my day around my calls, so I can work places and exercise and other things. If you don’t mind chatting with me in a coffee shop or something, then I don’t either.
	
### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
* *Tell us how we can change your mind, once it’s made up.*
* Help me understand. My brain gets stuck easily on what I see as contradictions, injustices, misalignments, etc. It can be a superpower for editing and making copy stronger, but it can also feel impossible to move forward if I can’t reconcile whatever seems off or unanswered.

### How do you like to give feedback?
* *Tell us the modes, means, timing, approach, and level of detail you like to employ when giving feedback, and why that's so.*
* Most “feedback” I give is in the form of editing. I often try to give the rationale for my suggestions and leave what’s likely an overwhelming number of comments. It may feel nit-picky, but know that I often spend far too long staring at just a handful of sentences trying to figure out why something doesn’t feel right, and it usually comes out stronger once it *does* feel right. 

### How do you like to get feedback?
* *Tell us the modes, means, timing, approach, and level of detail you like to see others employ when giving you feedback, and why that's so.*
* I like direct feedback, as hinting, indirect feedback can feel like passive aggressiveness.
